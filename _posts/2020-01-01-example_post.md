A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is a discussion or informational website
published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal
diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse
chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of
the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single
individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and often covered
a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged,
featuring the writing of multiple authors and sometimes professionally edited.
MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy
groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog
traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate
MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a
verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.

The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent
of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by
non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer
programming. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File
Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early
Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the
2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to
leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them
from other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form
of social networking service. Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to
post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers
and other bloggers.[3] However, there are high-readership blogs which do not
allow comments.
